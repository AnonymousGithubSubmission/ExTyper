### Additional Statistics

We extend the evaluation from three aspects:
1. New metric: MRR
2. New baseline: pyre
3. Time costs of the three components of Stray: preprocess (compiling and linking), type seeds collection and two-stage type checking/inference

The first two extensions are based on the original table of RQ1 and RQ2, see Extended Table 1 and Extended Table 2
The last extension is presented in the time_table.txt
